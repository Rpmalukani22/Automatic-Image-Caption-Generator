# Captionify.me: Automatic Image Caption Generator Webapp
<p style="text-align:justify">Captionify.me is a Deep Learning based single page Angular application that predicts captions for a given input image. The image captioning model has been trained on MS-COCO 2014 training dataset. In this project the Merge encoder-decoder model has been practically implemented to generate caption. The TTS component of the web application synthesizes the speech based on the output of the model.
