# Captionify.me: Automatic Image Caption Generator
Captionify.me is a Deep Learning based web application that predicts captions for a given input image. The image captioning model has been trained on MS-COCO 2014 training dataset. In this project the Merge encoder-decoder model has been practically implemented to generate caption. The TTS component of the web application synthesizes the speech based on the output of the model.
